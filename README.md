# Mine-Detection-Neural-Network-MLP-PCA
Using a neural network, a Multi-Level Perceptron, to train and test on the Kaggle [`Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/mattcarter865/mines-vs-rocks) version 1.16.5 or + .  In addition to the MLP, a primary component analysis is ran to predict which input components cause a difference in the dataset when creating a model for it.  SeaView database set on submarine if struct by mine or rock with given input data.
