# Mine-Detection-Neural-Network-Unsupervised-MLP-PCA
Using a neural network, a Multi-Level Perceptron, to train and test on the Kaggle [`Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/mattcarter865/mines-vs-rocks).
- The Mines vs Rocks dataset on submarine is designed where the rightmost column is a string, either "R"(Rock) or a "M"(Mine)
- The dataset is also non-labled for the inputs requiring for Unsupervised Learning, the Primary Component Analysis.  This is ran to predict which input components cause a difference in the dataset when creating a model for it.

## Requirements
- Python 3 
### Packages
- [`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/) version 1.16.5 or +  
- [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/) version 1.0.0 or +  
- [`scipy`](http://www.scipy.org/) version 1.3.1 or +
- [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/) version 1.3 or +
- [`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.or) version 0.21.3 or +
- [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) version 0.9.0 or +
* I used the [`Anaconda`](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) Environment to install these packages with additional, with Jupyter Notebook and Spyder IDE in addtion
* Other method to just download packages is [`Miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)
