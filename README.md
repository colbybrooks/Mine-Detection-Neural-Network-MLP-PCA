# Mine-Detection-Neural-Network-UnsupervisedML-MLP-PCA
Using a neural network, a Multi-Level Perceptron, to train and test on the Kaggle [`Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks Dataset`](https://www.kaggle.com/mattcarter865/mines-vs-rocks).
- The Mines vs Rocks dataset on submarine is designed where the rightmost column is a string, either "R"(Rock) or a "M"(Mine)
- The dataset is also non-labled for the inputs requiring for Unsupervised Learning, the Primary Component Analysis.  This is ran to predict which input components cause a difference in the dataset when creating a model for it.
