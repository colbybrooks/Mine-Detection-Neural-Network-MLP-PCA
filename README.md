# multiLevelPreceptron-primaryComponentAnalysis-MachineLearning
Using a neural network, a Multi-Level Perceptron, to train and test on the data provided.  In addition to the MLP, a primary component analysis is ran to predict which input components cause a difference in the dataset when creating a model for it.  Using SeaView database set on submarine if struct by mine or rock with given input data.
